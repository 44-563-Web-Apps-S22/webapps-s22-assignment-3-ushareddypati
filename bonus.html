<h1>Pirate Parrot</h1>
<p>mascot of the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball<strong><i> "Pirate Parrot"</i></strong></p>
<p>The Pirate Parrot is a costumed mascot of the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball. He was introduced in 1979 in response to the popularity of the Phillie Phanatic introduced one year earlier, as the Pirates and Philadelphia Phillies had a fierce intrastate rivalry at the time.  
The character of a parrot was derived from the classic story Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson, most notably the one owned by Long John Silver named "Captain Flint"</p>
